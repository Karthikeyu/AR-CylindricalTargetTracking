# AR-CylindricalTargetTracking

Hi! This repository contains an android based augmented reality application which was built using Vuforia, Unity and android SDK. The functionality of this app is to track a cylindrical object and augment different objects such as terrain, bushes, trees around the object. However, there is a slight problem encountered while tracking the cylindrical object. Object is tracked perfectly but, texture on the object is faded or occluded by other objects.
